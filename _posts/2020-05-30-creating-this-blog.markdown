Why?
-----------
To remind myself of what I've learned and to keep a somewhat organized learning path.

Who is the audience?
-----------
Me. If I happen to help others, great!

What will you write about?
-----------
Everything I'm learning related to software development. It could be about JavaScript, git, soft skills, how to learn, etc.

How often will you write?
-----------
Sporadically and unpredictably.

What was used to create this blog
-----------
The setup for this blog was by using Github Pages and Jekyll.

My requirement for setting up a blog was fast, easy, and with basic UI already created. These tools met all my requirements.

I already know basic markdown, so I didn't need to learn anything to make this blog work. Jekyll uses Liquid and Front Matter, which I'm not familiar with, but I don't predict myself using them.
I have only added a spell checker extension to my code editor.

I plan on doing some basic default css customization when I'm in the mood to care.
